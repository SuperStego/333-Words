This is a project I did for an intro to C class.

The goal was to create a Webserver that can play a game based on Words With Friends.

In this version of the game a word will be selected and the player will have to input every word that can be created using the letters provided.

The latest version is "Webserver_aidan"...

Once running input "localhost:8000/words" into a browser and the game should be playable.


The other files are earlier versions: 

"Webserver1.1" is just a webserver that will create a webserver and typing "localhost:8000/[file]", replacing [file] with a filepath on your system will display that file.

The other "wordsWithoutFriends," files are slowly implementing the functions needed for the whole game but 3.0 will give a game playable in the shell/console.
